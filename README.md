## Developing

## Testing

1. `yarn test`
2. `yarn run lint`

### Why does lint yell at me with a bunch of prittier junk OR why does my code keep moving around
We're using [prettier](prettier) for code formatting, it throws away any custom formatting you've done and pretty
prints in a defined format. No more space/tabs/brackets discussions.

###
How do I fix my stuff?
1. `yarn run lint -- --fix`
